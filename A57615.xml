         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Let every man therefore conſider, that he ſits at a great Table, let him conſider how he ought to be prepar'd, let him be Wary and Circumſpect.</p>
                  <p>Let him ſtand (6) upright not leaning on the Altar, let him joyn his Elbows to his Sides: Let him lift up his hands mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſo that the tops of his Fingers may be ſeen even with his (7) Shoulders.

                     <p n="1">(1) This Confeſſion is an Apiſh Imitation of what the Apoſtle Commands 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. viz. <hi>Let à man Examine himſelf,</hi> not confeſs to a Prieſt in his Ear, and receive his unſanctifyed Abſolution.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) The Papiſts hold that <hi>without</hi> this purpoſe whatſoever the Prieſt does, is meerly null and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; And therefore all that worſhip the Wafer he holds, commit downright IDOLATRY; for by their own Doctrine if the Prieſt has not a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it is <hi>no God.</hi> Now, no man living can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf that the Prieſt has a real purpoſe in what he does, becauſe no man knows the heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently can have no aſſured Faith, for true Faith and Doubt at the ſame time, are inconſiſtent.</p>

                  <p>THe Second Caution is, that he muſt not onely think, or ſuppoſe, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, that he has the requiſite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, that is, Wheaten Bread, and Wine with a little water. And thus he ſhall know that he hath both Wine and Water; Let him order the Clark to taſte both the Wine and the Water, (1) for the Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ought not to taſte them.</p>
                  <p>* Let him pour a drop into his hand, chafe it with his Finger, and ſmell to it, and ſo he ſhall be ſure. Let him not truſt to the Wine Crewet, nor to the colour, becauſe they often deceive a man. Let him take heed that the Chalice be not broken (or crackt) let him alſo take heed to the Wine, for if it be (2) corrupt he may in no wiſe Celebrate—If it be ſower, let him [<hi>diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet</hi>] Diſſemble. If too wateriſh, let him forbear, unleſs he knows that there is more Wine than Water.</p>
                  <p>And in every Caſe, if there happens a Doubt by reaſon of ſowerneſs, mixture, or Limpidity [<hi>Limpiditatem] (viz.</hi> tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency or clearnneſs) whether it may be made we adviſe him to forbear, becauſe in this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44394:9"/>
Sacrament nothing muſt be done doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein theſe words certainly muſt be ſaid, (<hi>viz.) For this is my Body and this is the Cup of my Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe let him chuſe the eveniſt and roundeſt hoſts, and pour in (3) a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent portion of Wine; For this Sacrament ought to ſerve the Sences of Seeing, Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Taſting, that they may be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the (4) outward ſhew, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding nouriſhed by the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein.</p>
                  <p>Let Water alſo be poured in a very ſmall quantity, &amp; let it have the reliſh of Wine, for there is no danger by putting in never ſo little Water but by putting in too much (5)</p>
                  <p>The Water is put in onely for a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and one drop ſignifies as much as a Thouſand. Let the Prieſt therefore take heed that he pour it in not too faſt, for fear there run in too much.</p>

                     <p n="2">(2) Such as are verſt in the myſtery of Tipling, ſay that good Wine makes good Blood, and good Blood a good Soul, <hi>Ergo</hi> he that will be ſaved muſt drink well. So this Bloodmaker muſt have good Wine, or elſe he makes but corrupt Blood.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) That is, a brimmer, when the Seaſon's hot, and the Prieſt dry.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) Well ſaid for once, if the outward ſigns ſerve the Senſes, and the Soul is nouriſhed by the thing ſignify'd, then here is no Corporal nor Material Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, but a Sacramental Eating, for the Soul and Mind have no Bodily Mouth.</p>

brief account of the Prieſts Maſſing Habit, which differs from a Biſhops when his Lordſhip gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble of ſaying Maſs. The Biſhop puts on nine ſeveral Vestments and a Meer Prieſt but ſix.</p>
                     <p>The Prieſt muſt be ſhod, though he hath vowed to go bare footed, for, ſay they, he is like a Warrier that fights with the Devil, in Defence of Chriſtians; Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go he muſt be Armed to Duel that Dreadful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Therefore he puts on his Shoes firſt, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy (in their ſenſe) the Humility of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>The Alb, is a kind of ſhirt of Mail, in their ſenſe repreſenting the Gown which <hi>Herod</hi> gave to Chriſt, in mockery. The Girdle with which he binds this Smock of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſignifies the Bow, with which theſe Archers kill Devils in this Holy War. The little Cord wherewith the Stole is tyed, denotes the Quiver wherein the Arrows are put. The Stole is the Breaſt-plate, which goes about the Neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Croſſes the Prieſts Belly like a Saint <hi>Andrew's</hi> Croſs, ſignifying the Cord with which Chriſt was bound when they ſcourged him.</p>
                     <p>The Manipule (that is the Childs ſwadling Band) is put about his Arms as a Bracelet, &amp; is inſtead of a Mace or Courtleax, denoting with all the Cord with which Chriſts Hands were bound.</p>
                     <p>The Chaſuble is a looſe Garment with a hole in the middle, through which the Prieſt like a Monkey puts his head, and ſo one part hangs before, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behind, in which undermost part is always a
